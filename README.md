# SkillSwap - Real-Time Skill Barter Platform

**SkillSwap** is a unique, real-time skill barter platform where users can trade their skills with each other. It's a modern digital version of the barter system ‚Äî no money involved! Users can offer their expertise (e.g., web development, design) and receive other skills in return (e.g., marketing, content creation). 

This project was built as part of a **hackathon** by a 2-person team using the **MERN stack** and real-time communication features.
